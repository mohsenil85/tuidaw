## What This Is

A terminal-based DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) in Rust. Uses ratatui for TUI rendering and SuperCollider via OSC for audio synthesis. Strips combine an oscillator source, filter, effects chain, LFO, envelope, and mixer controls into a single instrument unit. Strips are sequenced via piano roll.

## Directory Structure

```

## Key Types

| Type | Location | What It Is |
|------|----------|------------|
| `AppState` | `state/mod.rs` | Top-level state, owned by `main.rs`, passed to panes as `&AppState` |
| `StripState` | `state/strip_state.rs` | All strips, buses, piano roll, automation, custom synthdefs |
| `Strip` | `state/strip.rs` | One instrument: source + filter + effects + LFO + envelope + mixer |
| `StripId` | `state/strip.rs` | `u32` — unique identifier for strips |
| `OscType` | `state/strip.rs` | Oscillator source: Saw, Sin, Sqr, Tri, AudioIn, Sampler, Custom |
| `Action` | `ui/pane.rs` | ~50-variant enum for all user-dispatchable actions |
| `Pane` | `ui/pane.rs` | Trait: `id()`, `handle_input()`, `render()`, `keymap()` |
| `PaneManager` | `ui/pane.rs` | Owns all panes, manages active pane, dispatches input |

## Critical Patterns

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for detailed architecture, state ownership, borrow patterns, and persistence.

### Action Dispatch

Panes return `Action` values from `handle_input()`. `dispatch.rs` matches on them and mutates state. Panes never mutate state directly.

When adding a new action:
1. Add variant to `Action` enum in `src/ui/pane.rs`
2. Return it from the pane's `handle_input()`
3. Handle it in `dispatch::dispatch_action()` in `src/dispatch.rs`

### Navigation

Number keys switch panes (when not in exclusive input mode): `1`=strip, `2`=piano_roll, `3`=sequencer, `4`=mixer, `5`=server. `` ` ``/`~` for back/forward. `?` for context-sensitive help.

### Pane Registration

New panes must be:
1. Created in `src/panes/` and added to `src/panes/mod.rs`
2. Registered in `main.rs`: `panes.add_pane(Box::new(MyPane::new()));`
3. Given a number-key binding in the global key match block (if navigable)

## UI Framework API

### Keymap

```rust
Keymap::new()
    .bind('q', "action_name", "Description")
    .bind_key(KeyCode::Up, "action_name", "Description")
    .bind_ctrl('s', "action_name", "Description")
    .bind_alt('x', "action_name", "Description")
    .bind_ctrl_key(KeyCode::Left, "action_name", "Desc")
```

**There is no `bind_shift_key`.** Check `event.modifiers.shift` manually.

### Colors

`Color::new(r, g, b)` for custom RGB. Named constants: `Color::WHITE`, `Color::PINK`, `Color::SELECTION_BG`, `Color::MIDI_COLOR`, `Color::METER_LOW`. **No `Color::rgb()`** — use `Color::new()`.

### Pane Sizing

Most main panes use `Rect::centered(width, height, box_width, 29)` — height 29 is standard for full panes. Width varies by pane.

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo build                 # compile
cargo test --bin tuidaw     # unit tests (~41 tests)
cargo test                  # all tests including e2e
```

## Persistence

- Format: SQLite database (`.tuidaw` / `.sqlite`)
- Save/load: `StripState::save()` / `StripState::load()` in `src/state/persistence.rs`
- Default path: `~/.config/tuidaw/default.sqlite`
- Persists: strips, params, effects, filters, sends, modulations, buses, mixer, piano roll, automation, sampler configs, custom synthdefs

## LSP Integration (CCLSP)

Configured as MCP server (`cclsp.json` + `.mcp.json`). Provides rust-analyzer access. Prefer LSP tools over grep for navigating Rust code — they understand types, scopes, and cross-file references.

## Plans

Save implementation plans in `./plans/` with descriptive filenames (e.g., `plans/midi-clock-sync.md`, `plans/sample-browser-redesign.md`). Use names that clearly describe the feature or change being planned.

## Comment Box

Log difficulties, friction points, or things that gave you trouble in `COMMENTBOX.md` at the project root. This helps identify recurring pain points and areas where the codebase or documentation could be improved.
